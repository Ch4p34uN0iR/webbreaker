## Introduction `introduction`

### Description `description`
Build functional security testing, into your software development and release cycles! WebBreaker provides the capabilities to automate and centrally manage Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) as part of your DevOps pipeline.

## User Guide `user-guide`

### Installation: `installation`

#### Quick Local Installation 
Install WebBreaker from github.com.
* ```git clone https://github.com/target/webbreaker```
* ```export PATH=$PATH:$PYTHONPATH```
* ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
* ```python setup.py install```

#### Package Install
WebBreaker releases are packaged on github.com and can be installed locally.
* ```pip install -e git+https://github.com/target/webbreaker.git#egg=webbreaker```

### Supported Features: `supported_features`

* Jenkins global environmental variable inheritance with scan options.
* WebInspect REST API support for v9.30 and above.

* [Superset data visualization dashboard](https://github.com/airbnb/superset) support for scan status and performance.

### Usage `usage`
Webbreaker utilizes a structure of upper-level and lower-level commands to enable interaction with multiple 3rd party platforms. The two platforms currently supported are WebInspect and Fortfiy and they can be accessed using their respective upper-level commands. Webbreaker supports multiple functions for each platform which are accessed via lower-level commands. The current command structure is listed below.

- webbreaker
    - webinspect
        - download
        - list
        - proxy
        - scan
        - servers
    - fortify
        - list
        - upload
        - scan
        - download
    - admin
        - notifier
        - agent
        - credentials
        - secret
    - threadfix
        - list
        - teams
        - applications
        - scans
        - upload
        - create_app

A proper Webbreaker command utilizes the structure 'webbreaker [webinspect|fortify|admin] [lower-level command] [OPTIONS]'

### Logging `logging`
WebBreaker may be implemented with Elastic Stack for log aggregation. Recommended compenents include 
Filebeat agents installed on all WebInspect servers, forwarding to Logstash, and visualized in Kibana. General 
implementation details are [here](https://qbox.io/blog/welcome-to-the-elk-stack-elasticsearch-logstash-kibana/).  
A recommended approach is to tag log events and queries with ```WebInspect``` and ```webbreaker```, but remember 
queries are case sensitive.

### Testing `testing`
#### Requirements
1. Be in your project root to run tests. 
    * ```pip install -rrequirements.txt```
2. Python2.7 and Python3.6 are currently tested in our tox.ini file
    * If you want to test it against your current version python, you can the other ways to test. Tox is 
    suggested though. 
    
#### Tox
We use detox instead of tox for the speed of concurrent testing. With the speed of testing, comes a lack of 
coverage output
* ```detox```

Tox will allow you to see the coverage.py results.
* ```tox```

#### Other ways to test
These can test against your version of python without creating seperate virtualenv. For isolation of issues 
and ease of use it is suggested that you use tox. 
```
python setup.py install
pytest
```
```
python setup.py install
python setup.py test
```

### Notifications `notifications`
WebBreaker provides notifications for start-scan and end-scan events. A simple publisher/subscriber 
pattern is implemented under the ```webbreaker/notifiers```.  A Reporter object will hold a collection
of Notifiers, each of which implements a Notify function responsible for creating the desired notification. 
Currently, two notification types are implemented email and database.

The email notifier merges the provided event data into an HTML email message and sends the message. All SMTP-related 
settings are stored in [webbreaker/etc/email.ini](https://github.com/target/webbreaker/blob/master/webbreaker/etc/email.ini)
, and read during the webbreaker execution.

If an error occurs on behalf of the notifiers at any point during the process of creating or sending 
notifications, the event will be logged, without any interruption of WebBreaker execution or the WebInspect scan.

## Configuration `configuration`

This is a complete example of what will be generated under ~/.webbreaker/config.ini on the first WebBreaker run

To import your own config settings, overwrite or modify `~/.webbreaker/config.ini`

##### ssc_url
URL of the fortify server to contact

##### project_template
Static value

##### application_name
Static Value

##### username
Fortify username that will be used for authentication with ssc_url. It is stored using an encrypted value. Use 
`webbreaker admin credentials --fortify` to set your username & password.

##### password
Fortify username that will be used for authentication with ssc_url. It is stored using an encrypted value. Use 
`webbreaker admin credentials --fortify` to set your username & password.


### ThreadFix `threadfix_config`
Can be found under `[threadfix]`

##### host
Threadfix host that will be contacted for requests

##### api_key
This api key to authenticate ThreadFix actions requested.

### WebInspect `webinspect_config`
Can be found under `[webinspect]` & `[webinspect_policy]`. 

#### git_token
Store Git API auth token for url of `git_repo`. Make sure this token has access to `git_repo`

#### git_repo
This is the git repo that will be used to automate the pulling of policies and settings.  

#### default_size
The default size used for scans when not specified. 

#### size_
Sets the number for large and small WebInspect scan servers. This helps with _Just-In-Time_ (JIT) scheduling

#### server_
Used with interpolation to create endpoints with server and size. This is the endpoint that you will be hitting 
for the webinspect scans

#### endpoint_
Provides a _Just-In-Time_ (JIT) scheduler or the ability to load balance scans amongst a WebInspect cluster. This is 
possible with sizes of the servers combined with endopints.

#### webinspect_policy
WebInspect scan configuration files for `policies` are versioned and hosted from a GIT repository determined 
in `git_repo`  Additionally, all WebInspect policies and servers are managed from this configuration file. 

All WebInspect distributions are packaged with a `Default.xml` file that may be overridden and uploaded 
to the WebInspect deployment with the webbreaker option `--settings`.  The setting xml file contains 
all possible options for your scan including, a WebInspect scan including policy, workflow and/or login 
macro, scan depth, and allowed hosts.

Grouping of proprietary WebInspect tests to perform.  Tests or rules are represented in an `xml` element with 
a `.policy` file extension.  Custom tests or Checks are mapped to a unique WebInspect ID.  The mapping for all 
policies shipped with WebInspect are mapped with their respective GUID within the `[webinspect_policies]` section.

*Note:* All custom polices are automatically uploaded to the targeted WebInspect server and must be referenced 
as a GUID.  


### Email `email_config`
Can be found under `[emailer]`.
Notifications for start-scan and end-scan events. A simple publisher/subscriber pattern is implemented under 
the "notifiers" folder.

A Reporter object holds a collection of Notifier objects, each of which implements a Notify function responsible 
for creating the desired notification. Currently, two notification types are implemented email and database.

The email notifier merges the provided event data into an HTML email message and sends the message. All 
SMTP-related settings are stored in .emailrc, and read during program startup.

Your smtp server that you will be sending your emails from

####smtp_port
SMTP port that will be used when sending emails. 

####from_address
Email address name that will be used for sending emails. 

####to_address
Who you will be sending emails to on specified events 

####default_to_address
If you want to set a default address, if no to address was set

####chatroom
Currently only supporting email notifications.

####email_template
The template to be used while notifying through emails. 

## Verbose Cheatsheet: Webinspect `webinspect_cheatsheet`

#### WebInspect Downlaod `webinspect_download`
##### Options

##### Commands
For these examples, assume the server has scans with names important_site_auth, important_site_api, important_site_internal

Download the results from the important_site_auth scan found on webinspect-server-2.example.com:8083 as an fpr file
```
webbreaker webinspect download --server webinspect-server-2.example.com:8083 --scan_name important_site_auth
```

Because multiple scan names on webinspect-server-2.example.com:8083 match 'important_site', this command will list them in output and no files will be downloaded
```
webbreaker webinspect download --server webinspect-server-2.example.com:8083 --scan_name important_site
```

Download the results of scan 'important_site_auth' from webinspect-server-2.example.com:8083 in xml format
```
webbreaker webinspect download --server webinspect-server-2.example.com:8083 --scan_name important_site_auth -x xml
```

Download WebInspect scan by ID. Scan will be downloaded as important_site_auth.fpr (This is helpful when multiple scans have the same_name):
```
webbreaker webinspect download --server webinspect-2.example.com:8083 --scan_name important_site_auth --scan_id my_important_scans_id
```

Download the results from the important_site_auth scan found on webinspect-server-2.example.com:8083 as an fpr file. All interaction with webinspect-server-2.example.com:8083 will use http instead of https
```
webbreaker webinspect download --server webinspect-server-2.example.com:8083 --scan_name important_site_auth --protocol http
